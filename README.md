# About

This repository provides service definitions for a streaming protocol to stream Open Vector Format (OVF) files in a server client architecture. 


# State Machine

The state machine is a bi-dircetional streaming to exchange the state of server and client. This allows to sychronize both ends and to handle errors or to abort a job.


# Streaming 

The streaming service defines unidirectional streaming of OVF objects from the server to a client.
